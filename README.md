Edge Detection Experiment
Overview
This project involves experimenting with two popular edge detection algorithms: Sobel and Canny Edge Detector. The goal is to explore the impact of different kernel sizes and threshold values on the effectiveness of these algorithms.

Algorithms Explored
Sobel Operator:

The Sobel operator is a gradient-based edge detection method. It was experimented with various kernel sizes to observe the effect on edge detection.
Canny Edge Detector:

Canny edge detector is a multi-stage algorithm that involves Gaussian smoothing, gradient computation, non-maximum suppression, and edge tracking. Different threshold values were tested to analyze their impact on edge detection.
